Pokedex app -- Work in progress

 App that connects to Pokemon API and retrieves the list of pokemon, also displays its abilities, picture, and type. User can also catch or release pokemon.


Future project todo:
- Usage of shared preferences to save the state of the pokemon button catch or release is still under review and fixing. 
- The view on Main activity is buggy as it should show the whole list of Pokemon's list, instead of blank.
